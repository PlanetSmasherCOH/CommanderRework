description = "Since there's quite a few Commanders in the game that almost nobody uses (for good reason), I started reworking some of them to make them more useful and fun to play. This mod is in a very early stage, so there's probably lots of bugs and OP stuff. If you think anything is awesome/horrible/not working, post it in the comments! I appreciate all kinds of feedback, as long as it's constructive.\n__________\n\nHow to use the mod:\n1. Subscribe.\n2. Start a custom game. Mods only work in custom games!\n3.
