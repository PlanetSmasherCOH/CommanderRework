description = "Since there's quite a few Commanders in the game that almost nobody uses (for good reason), I started reworking some of them to make them more useful and fun to play. This mod is in a very early stage, so there's probably lots of bugs and OP stuff. If you think anything is awesome/horrible/not working, post it in the comments! I appreciate all kinds of feedback, as long as it's constructive.\n\nHow to use the mod:\n1. Subscribe.\n2. Start a custom game. Mods only work in custom games!\n3. Click 'Options', for 'Tuning Pack', select 'Commander Rework'.\n4. Put one of the commanders in your loadout and use it in game!\n(The changes will only show up in the match, once you picked the commander.)\n\nCurrently included:\n\nGerman Mechanized Doctrine\nElite Troops Doctrine\nGerman Defensive Doctrine\nGerman Infantry Doctrine\nJaeger Infantry Doctrine\n\nRecon Support Company\nMechanized Company\n\nConscript Support Tactics\nTank Hunter Tactics\nNKVD Rifle Disruption Tactics\nUrban Defense Tactics\nDefensive Tactics\n\nA detailed list of all features is available here: http://pastebin.com/RV2i9snF\n\nComing next: USF Airborne Company.
