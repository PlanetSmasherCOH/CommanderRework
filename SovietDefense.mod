					<Description>Since there's quite a few Commanders in the game that almost nobody uses (for good reason), I started reworking some of them to make them more useful and fun to play. This mod is in a very early stage, so there's probably lots of bugs and OP stuff. If you think anything is awesome/horrible/not working, post it in the comments! I appreciate all kinds of feedback, as long as it's constructive.
__________

How to use the mod:
1. Subscribe.
2. Start a custom game. Mods only work in custom games!
3. Click 'Options', for 'Tuning Pack', select 'Commander Rework'.
4. Put one of the commanders in your loadout and use it in game!
(The changes will only show up in the match, once you picked the commander.)
__________

German Mechanized Doctrine

0CP: Sd.Kfz. 250/1
Comes without a squad of Grenadiers. Now has an MG42 with the stats from the larger Sd.Kfz. 251/1 halftrack. Cost, health, armor, movement and veterancy copied from the Soviet M3A1. (Also available in Mechanized Assault Doctrine!)
1CP: Sd.Kfz. 223 Command Car
Costs 250MP/20Fu. This is a 222 with an MG42 instead of the 20mm gun; DPS is similar to the USF M20. It can throw smoke grenades as well as capture and lock down territory. The lockdown is improved with each rank of veterancy; the unit itself does not get better.
2CP: Withdraw and Refit
Copied from USF. Vehicles can be retreated from the battlefield to get some resources back.
5CP: Spotting Scopes
These are also available on the new vehicles in this commander.
9CP: StuH 42
This is basically a leFH 18 howitzer strapped to a StuG III. It performs similar to the Brummbär, so it's very effective against infantry blobs. Can be upgraded with an MG42 and Spotting Scope and gets a long-range artillery barrage at Vet 1.
