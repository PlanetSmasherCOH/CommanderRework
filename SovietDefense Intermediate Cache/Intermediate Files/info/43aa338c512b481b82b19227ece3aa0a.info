description = "Since there's quite a few Commanders in the game that almost nobody uses (for good reason), I started reworking some of them to make them more useful and fun to play. This mod is in a very early stage, so there's probably lots of bugs and OP stuff. If you think anything is awesome/horrible/not working, post it in the comments! I appreciate all kinds of feedback, as long as it's constructive.\r\n__________\r\n\r\nHow to use the mod:\r\n1. Subscribe.\r\n2. Start a custom game. Mods only work in custom games!\r\n3. Click 'Options', for 'Tuning Pack', select 'Commander Rework'.\r\n4. Put one of the commanders in your loadout and use it in game!\r\n(The changes will only show up in the match, once you picked the commander.)\r\n__________\r\n\r\nGerman Mechanized Doctrine\r\n\r\n0CP: Sd.Kfz. 250/1\r\nComes without a squad of Grenadiers.

(Also available in Mechanized Assault Doctrine!)\r\n1CP: Sd.Kfz. 223 Command Car\r\nCosts 250MP/20Fu. This is a 222 with an MG42 instead of the 20mm gun; DPS is similar to the USF M20. It can throw smoke grenades as well as capture and lock down territory. The lockdown is improved with each rank of veterancy; the unit itself does not get better.\r\n2CP: Withdraw and Refit\r\nCopied from USF. Vehicles can be retreated from the battlefield to get some resources back.\r\n5CP: Spotting Scopes\r\nThese are also available on the new vehicles in this commander.\r\n9CP: StuH 42\r\nThis is basically a leFH 18 howitzer strapped to a StuG III. It performs similar to the Brummb?r, so it's very effective against infantry blobs. Can be upgraded with an MG42 and Spotting Scope and gets a long-range artillery barrage at Vet 1.\r\n__________\r\n\r\nElite Troops Doctrine\r\n\r\n1CP: Jaeger Light Infantry\r\nGewehr 43 + Interrogation for 45 munitions.

Pioneers can also build tank traps and trenches. You can garrison mortars in trenches with full functionality.\r\n8CP: Pak 43\r\n9CP: Panzer IV Command Tank\r\n12CP: Sector Artillery\r\nRate of fire ramps up faster and there is less initial delay.\r\n__________\r\n\r\nGerman Infantry Doctrine\r\n\r\n0CP: Opel Blitz Ambulance\r\nFunctions just like the USF ambulance. Same cost, ability, movement speed, armor. Slightly more HP, but easier to hit.\r\n1CP: Defensive Fortifications\r\nAll infantry (except for the officer) can build sandbags. Pioneers can also build tank traps and trenches. You can garrison mortars in trenches with full functionality.\r\n2CP: Panzerb?chse 39\r\nAvailable on Grenadiers.
